### Setting up Dev

To get started you can clone our GitHub project to your own desired repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/yhuang-15/AdvancedDataArchitecture_G9.git
```

To test the workflow, one has to: <br />
    1. deploy the workflow on some workflow engine (e.g., Google Workflow) <br />
    2. deploy all the services that would be called by the workflow <br />

## Introduction

This course is about data architectures which is a framework for managing data. For this assignment specifcally the purpose was to implement services which were identified in assingment 2 where had to  design and document a SOA-based solution for our case study which is apartment renting.

## Developing

### Built With

### Prerequisites
An account on the Google Cloud Platform is optional as these services can be deployed on this platform. <br />
https://cloud.google.com/free

An API client is also necessary for testing purposes, one example for a client is Insomnia. <br />
https://insomnia.rest/

A local device is recommended because the Google Cloud Platform is not free, so in order to be efficient and cost-saving. We recommend to use a local machine for the API client, inspecting or modifying the code.

## Style guide

Our python code is written in PEP-8 style, which is the style guide for python code by Guido van Rossum.
