To deploy the function,

gcloud functions deploy send_email --runtime python38 --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated --set-env-vars SENDGRID_API_KEY=YourSendGridKey

To execute the function,

Send a POST (to the HTTP function URL) with a json body of

{

  "from": "the email address given for sendgrid sender",

  "to": "any",

  "subject": "any",

  "message":"any"

}

If you have not completed setting configurations correctly, you may get an error
